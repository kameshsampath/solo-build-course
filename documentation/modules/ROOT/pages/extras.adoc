[#using-credentials]
== Using Credentials

At many cases when running workshops, it might be required that we may need to pass username and password that needs to be updated in the instructions. 

The courseware UI is built in to handle the query parameters passed as *USER* and *PASSWORD* to be automatically replaced in the documentation. 

For the replacement to happen the content documentation should have the following tokens:

- %USER% or $USERNAME
- %PASSWORD% or $PASSWORD

Hello *%USER%* your password is *%PASSWORD%*

If you have open the link:{site-url}/rhs-build-course/extras.html#using-credentials?USER=foo&PASSWORD=bar[url^], you will see the same page with tokens replaced.

[#vscod-snippets]
== VSCode Snippets

To aid easier development with tools like https://code.visualstudio.com[Visual Studio Code], the course template repository provides you with a https://github.com/kameshsampath/demo-docs-site-template/blob/main/vscode-asciidoc-extra.json[snippets] that can be added to vscode, to allow quick inserts of commonly used snippets. 

//TODO #1 add video to show how to import and use the snippet

Another handy plugin is https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-vscode#how-to-install[asciidoctor-vscode]

[#web-terminal]
== Web Terminal

In order to conveniently provide all of the CLI tools needed for an
individual to go through a course, a web-based terminal container image is
available. This container image is based on
link:https://tsl0922.github.io/ttyd/[TTYD], and we are maintaining our
link:https://github.com/redhat-scholars/ttyd-openshift[own derivative].

Each course should provide a set of instructions for how to deploy the
web-based terminal into the cluster. If you have a specific set of tools that
is not provided in the base TTYD image that Red Hat Scholars provides, you
should create a derivative image with your tools and make it available in the
link:https://quay.io/organization/redhat-scholars[Red Hat Scholars Quay]
organization with a name that matches your course's ID.
